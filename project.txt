Hypertension Classification from PPG Signals Using Machine Learning

Objective:
Classify subjects as normotensive, prehypertensive, or hypertensive using PPG-based features.

Methodology:
    Acquire labeled BP datasets (e.g., MIMIC, UCI PPG-BP).  
    Preprocessing:
    Denoising and normalization

Feature extraction:
    Systolic peak height, notch-to-peak time
    HR, HRV features from pulse
    Statistical descriptors: mean, SD, kurtosis

Train classifiers:
    SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
    Evaluate using: Confusion matrix, Accuracy, Precision, F1-score

Outcome:
An interpretable hypertension screening system from PPG signals.
